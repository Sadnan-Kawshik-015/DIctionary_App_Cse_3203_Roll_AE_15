* Description: Here I used 2 2d array to implement 2 level hashing . My Keyset includes English Words and Bangla
* Words. So one array is used for storing Bangla words and other array is used for storing equivalent english word.
* Here there are some collisions but it is minimal as taking the square size of array for each slot minimizes the
* collision number to less than 1/2.The number of keys in my data set is 1000.No firebase or SQL database is used in
* this implementation*/
